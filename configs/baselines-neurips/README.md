## Neurips 2021 Datasets & Benchmarks Baselines
This folder contains template configs for the baseline models trained for 2021 NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks Track.
Configs are separated based on the SKM-TEA Track and task for which the models were trained. The config files that were used
for training can be found in the [model zoo](../../MODEL_ZOO.md).

### Using template configs
The template configs provide the parameters that are used to construct, train, and evaluate the model. Parameters denoted with a `# TODO` tag indicate that they must
be filled out by the user prior to use. These parameters typically are accompanied
by choices that the user can select from.
