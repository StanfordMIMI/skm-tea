===============

SKM-TEA introduces a family of standardized metrics based on quantatitative MRI (qMRI) biomarkers,
which have been shown to be strong indicators of knee health. 

Existing metrics in ML practice are not well correlated with the qMRI metric.
Thus, we **strongly recommend** using this metric when evaluating your methods.
